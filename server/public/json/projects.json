Minswap is a community-centric DEX, in that our tokens are fairly distributed, without any private or VC investment.\n\nMinswap has pioneered several ideas in the Cardano ecosystem such as the FISO model, touted as the fairest ISO model in the Cardano community, and they plan to continue developing several value adding features.This will benefit both the Minswap community, and the Cardano community as a whole."
